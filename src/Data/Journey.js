        description: `<p>Pizzaman started with the sales of pizza in slices in 2018 January. It started in a rented apartment located opposite the Sharp Kids Academy at Kotei-Kumasi in the Ashanti region of Ghana. This venture was started by 2 students Namely Christian Boakye Yiadom and Ebenezer Essuman-Amankwah who read BSc Actuarial Science and BSc Mathematics respectively with the immense support of Prince Owusu, who was also a student of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology.</p> 
        
        <p className='pt-10'>After their first contract, which was awarded by the then SRC womenâ€™s Commissioner of KNUST namely Miss. Ruth Anku-Gbetanu, a lot of orders came in from other organisations such as the Medical Students Association (KNUST), Social Sciences Students Association, and the National Union of Ghana Students (NUGS_KNUST). News about PIZZAMAN began to spread as it was a bit surprising to see a former Presidential aspirant of the KNUST students Representative Council engaging in a food business.</p>`

        description: `<p>Eventually, the market share grew and there was a need to introduce the selling of full boxes of pizza. The first commercial full box of pizza was sold on 14th April 2018. It then continued from that day until June 2018 where business went on a recess due to financial obstacles.</p> <p>On 7th September 2018, Pizzaman was moved from the apartment in Kotei to a small shop at Ayeduase, opposite the Victory Towers Hostel. From that period, pizza was sold daily. A revenue of GHC12,000 was generated in the first month of operation, which looked promising. October 2018 would have been a great month until there was a student demonstration at KNUST which led to the closedown of the pizzeria since the market was targeted at students during those moments.</p>`

        description: `<p>We had a joint venture agreement with Quick Angels GHANA limited.</p> <p>And that was when we came up with Chickenman, a sister brand to pizzaman and they are all under CEQA foods. The idea of chickenman was not to make the pizza over shadow our rice dishes</p>  <p>Pizzaman along the line attracted some innovators, and these people eventually became a part of the team. Miss Kekeli Awume and Mr. Martin Dari.In May 2019, Pizzaman closed down again and came up stronger with a sister Brand Called Chickenman in January 2020.</p>`
