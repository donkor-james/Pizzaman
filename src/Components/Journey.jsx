                  Pizzaman started with the sales of pizza in slices in 2018
                  January. It started in a rented apartment located opposite the
                  Sharp Kids Academy at Kotei-Kumasi in the Ashanti region of
                  Ghana. This venture was started by 2 students Namely Christian
                  Boakye Yiadom and Ebenezer Essuman-Amankwah who read BSc
                  Actuarial Science and BSc Mathematics respectively with the
                  immense support of Prince Owusu, who was also a student of
                  Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology.

                  After their first contract, which was awarded by the then SRC
                  women’s Commissioner of KNUST namely Miss. Ruth Anku-Gbetanu,
                  a lot of orders came in from other organisations such as the
                  Medical Students Association (KNUST), Social Sciences Students
                  Association, and the National Union of Ghana Students
                  (NUGS_KNUST). News about PIZZAMAN began to spread as it was a
                  bit surprising to see a former Presidential aspirant of the
                  KNUST students Representative Council engaging in a food
                  business.

                  Eventually, the market share grew and there was a need to
                  introduce the selling of full boxes of pizza. The first
                  commercial full box of pizza was sold on 14th April 2018. It
                  then continued from that day until June 2018 where business
                  went on a recess due to financial obstacles.

                <p className="pt-5">
                  On 7th September 2018, Pizzaman was moved from the apartment
                  in Kotei to a small shop at Ayeduase, opposite the Victory
                  Towers Hostel. From that period, pizza was sold daily. A
                  revenue of GHC12,000 was generated in the first month of
                  operation, which looked promising. October 2018 would have
                  been a great month until there was a student demonstration at
                  KNUST which led to the closedown of the pizzeria since the
                  market was targeted at students during those moments.

                  And that was when we came up with Chickenman, a sister brand
                  to pizzaman and they are all under CEQA foods. The idea of
                  chickenman was not to make the pizza over shadow our rice

                  Pizzaman along the line attracted some innovators, and these
                  people eventually became a part of the team. Miss Kekeli Awume
                  and Mr. Martin Dari.In May 2019, Pizzaman closed down again
                  and came up stronger with a sister Brand Called Chickenman in
                  January 2020.
